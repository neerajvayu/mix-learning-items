A limited number of network ports are open on ESXi. The most
important ports and services are the following:
•
80 — This port serves a reverse proxy that is open only to
display a static Web page that you see when browsing to the
server. Otherwise, this port redirects all traffic to port 443 to
provide SSL-encrypted communications to the ESXi host.
•
443 (reverse proxy) — This port also acts as a reverse proxy to
a number of services to provide SSL-encrypted communica
-
tion to these services. The services include the
VMware Virtual
Infrastructure API (VI API)
, which provides access to the RCLIs,
VI Client, VirtualCenter Server, and the SDK.
•
427 (service location protocol) — This port provides access for
the service location protocol, a generic protocol to search for
the VI API.
•
5989 — This port is open for the CIM server, which is an inter
-
face for Third-party management tools.
•
902 — This port is open to support the older VIM API, specifi
-
cally the older versions of the VI Client and VirtualCenter.
