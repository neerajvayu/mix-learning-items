Error: The VMRC Console has Disconnected.. Attempting to reconnect
Cause
This issue occurs due to an Application Control software such as antivirus software that blocks certain applications or functions of installed software on client/server systems.

Note: Access to Web GUI of the security server or hosted portal is important to disable certain settings depending on antivirus architecture.
Resolution
To resolve this issue, use one of these options:
Disable application control for virtual applications through the antivirus software.
Uninstall and reinstall the vSphere Client.
Stop the vmware-vmrc.exe*32 service from Windows Task Manager and log in again.
