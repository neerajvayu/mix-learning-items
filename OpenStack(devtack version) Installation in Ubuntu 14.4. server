Let’s take a machine with Ubuntu 14.4 server installed in it.
I am assuming minimal installation
You can create git clone of openstack devstack package
First install git by apt-get install git
Now run git command which will create a clone git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack
cd devstack; ./stack.sh
These are the steps required to install it but the moment you will start it will show you multiple errors.
The very first error is it will tell you can you can’t run stack.sh in root mode
You can create a user stack and set the password in additional way
#useradd stack;passwd stack
But I recommend to run the script which you can fine in devstack directory which will create required users.
#./tools/create-stack-user.sh
[Note- make sure you have mapped the hostname in DNS , if not put the entry in /etc/hosts file]
Now switch to the user stack and run the script which will show you permission error.
Change the ownership and permission by below command
#chown -R stack:stack /tech-jockey_test/devstack

Now I think it’s time to run the final script but it will create issue and give you error that it is not able to download the package from GIT_BASE=${GIT_BASE:-git://www.github.com}
Now your task is to open a file vim /devstack/stackrc
Go to line no 164 and modify the line as follows(replace git with https).
GIT_BASE=${GIT_BASE:-https://www.github.com}
All set now run the script ./stack.sh it will ask you to enter password for its diff services.
Once you enter the passwords it will take around 20 minute to install the bundle and then you can access openstack by opening its in browser.
This is your host IP address: 192.168.122.123
This is your host IPv6 address: ::1
Horizon is now available at http://dummy_IP/
Keystone is serving at http://Dummy_IP:5000/
The default users are: admin and demo
The password: dummy
