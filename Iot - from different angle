IoT - Internet of Things
It's not only that you open the door and get the temperature.
It's like whenever a mother want she can get her baby's health condition instantly without touching her, Seem funny.
A kind of trend analysis where a device is so much intelligent that it can give exact figure of her baby.

It include data analytics based on trends and about developing such level of automation where it can check any device.
In the IoT world device will contact with each other like without calling my friend i will inform him that i am coming to his doorstep and if he do not like me his device will answer that he is not at home :)

It can be helpfull in heavy machinaries like Gas filtering machine is very complex and you need to check each and every pump to predict it's future behaviour, example you need to send small drone through out the gas pipe to check health,
drone will move and stop at each corner and contact with IoT sensor about its health, it would collect all the required data and after come back push it back to the system to further analysis, if anything suspecious found it would send alert to the mechanic
